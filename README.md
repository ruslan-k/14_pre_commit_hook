# Quadratic Equations Solver

This project demonstrates how to use pre commit hooks in git.

1. Copy ```pre-commit``` file in ```.git/hooks/``` directory, give it execution permission ```chmod +x pre-commit```.
2. Add something to staged area and try to commit. You will see an error message than commit is unsuccessful because of failed tests.
3. Solve problem in ```quadratic_equation.py```, check that all tests run correctly, add it to staged area and try to commit again. You will see a message that commit is successful.
